Project 6 (+,++) CAM and object detection: 
First, you should implement some standard method for CAM for some (simple) classification network trained on image-level tags. 
You should also obtain object detection (spacial localization of the object approximate "center"). 
You should apply your approach to one specific object type (e.g. faces, or anything else). 
Training should be done on image-level tags (e.g. face, no face). You can come up with your specialized dataset, but feel free to use subsets of standard data. 
You can also test the ideas on real datasets where label noise is presemt
